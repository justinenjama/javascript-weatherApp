# Weather App using JavaScript

This project is a simple weather application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
It allows users to search for the current weather conditions in any city by entering the city name in the search bar. 
The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays essential information such as temperature, humidity,
wind speed, and weather description, along with an icon representing the weather conditions. 
The user interface is designed to be clean and responsive for a smooth experience across different devices.
